# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Adamou Tidjani

I'm a Computer Science student who loves turning ideas into real, working software. Whether it's building tools to help students with their college applications or diving into data to find meaningful insights, I enjoy solving problems with code.

Right now, I'm especially interested in full-stack development and data science â€” basically anything that lets me build, analyze, and improve systems that people actually use.

## ðŸš€ Projects I'm Proud Of

### ðŸŽ“ [College Application Assistant]
A full-stack web app that helps high school students stay on top of college and vocational school applications.

- Google OAuth 2.0 login  
- Dynamic forms that change based on user input  
- MongoDB backend to save and load form data  
- Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

### ðŸ“Š [Clustering & Classification Explorer]
A machine learning project where I compared different clustering and classification models.

- Explored KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and more  
- Used PCA to visualize high-dimensional data  
- Evaluated models with cross-validation and confusion matrices

### ðŸ§  [Breast Cancer Prediction with Neural Nets]
Tried out different machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

- Compared SVMs and MLP neural networks  
- Tested different preprocessing techniques (like normalization)  
- Visualized the impact of model parameters like `C` and `gamma`
